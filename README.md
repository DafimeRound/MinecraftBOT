## Tips

There are environnement variable to override the default value of host, port, username and password
- `MC_BOT_HOST` for the host

They are some builtin commands in the bot

- `difficulty` get the difficulty of the server
- `food` get the food level of the player
- `help` get all the disponible commands, their description and their usage
- `health` get the health of the player
- `list` get the players connected (Sometimes the packet is glitched, you can use the status button go get the players)
